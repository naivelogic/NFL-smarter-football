    "## Success Rates\n",
    "\n",
    "Success Rates:  Using success rates to measure efficiency is superior to traditional yards per play (per pass or per rush) because it adds a layer of context to the play:  the down and distance to go.  Example:  a 10 yard run on 3rd and 26 will add 10 yards/carry to a running back's average.  But that play resulted in 4th and 16 and thus, an unsuccessful attempt to convert a first down (and graded as an unsuccessful play).  \n",

    "Successful Plays = Frequency that a play generates required ydg (based on down/distance) to grade as successful\n",

    "Per [Football Outsiders](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/stat-analysis/2004/introducing-running-back-success-rate), a run is considered a success if it satisfies the following benchmarks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gains 40% of yards needed on first down, 60% of yards needed on second down, or 100% of yards needed on third down\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the offense is behind by more than a touchdown in the fourth quarter, the first/second/third down benchmarks change to 50%/65%/100%, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the offense is ahead by any amount in the fourth quarter, the first/second/third down benchmarks change to 30%/50%/100%, respectively.\n",
